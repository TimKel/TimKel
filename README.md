- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimKel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and looking to learn Javascript and Python next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects to learn debugging and further my understanding.
- If you have any insight or tips I would love to connect!
